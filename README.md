# CS452-Final Project
Final Project for CS452 - Computer Graphics

## Compatibility

Check if your browser is usable here:

https://get.webgl.org/webgl2/

## Serving

These files can be ran locally so that you may test without pinging the hydra machine (so you can work offline, or in the event Hydra is powered off). You must run from a browser compatible with WebGL2 and a computer made in the last half century.

If you have python3 installed:

```
cd ~/starter/code/dir/containing/index_file
python3 -m http.server 5000
```

If you have npm installed (recommended)

1) Install serve (it is a global install, be warned!)
2) serve the dir

```
npm i -g serve
cd ~/starter/code/dir/containing/index_file
serve
```
